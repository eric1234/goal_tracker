# Goal Tracker

This project will allow you to define daily goals you want to accomplish for
yourself. Each day you can grade yesterday's goals on a scale 0-10. It will
report some statistics for you to indicate if you are improving or getting
worse.

The goal is not to track every little activity as that generally does not work
for me. Just need to take a moment each morning and ask how I did on the
previous day giving myself a grade for my success.

## Development

Install the dependencies...

```bash
cd goal-tracker
npm install
```

...then start [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org):

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

## Building

To create an optimised version of the app:

```bash
npm run build
```

Then copy the `public` directory to wherever you want to deploy the app.
